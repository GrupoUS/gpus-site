## Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation [SEQUENTIAL]

### Task 1: [Component Name]

**Files:**

- Create: `exact/path/to/file.ts`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.ts:123-145`
- Test: `tests/path/to/test.ts`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

\`\`\`typescript
test('specific behavior', () => {
const result = processInput(input);
expect(result).toBe(expected);
});
\`\`\`

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `bun test tests/path/test.ts`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

\`\`\`typescript
export function processInput(input: InputType): OutputType {
return expected;
}
\`\`\`

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `bun test tests/path/test.ts`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**

\`\`\`bash
git add tests/path/test.ts src/path/file.ts
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
\`\`\`

### Phase 2: Core [PARALLEL]

> ⚡ PARALLEL-SAFE: Can run simultaneously

### Task 2: [Backend Component]

**Owner:** debugger
[Same structure as Task 1]

### Task 3: [Frontend Component]

**Owner:** frontend-specialist
[Same structure as Task 1]

### Phase 3: Integration [SEQUENTIAL]

### Task 4: [Integration]

[Same structure as Task 1]

## Handoff

**Options:**

1. Implement now — `/implement`
2. Review first — Open plan file
3. Modify plan — Adjust before execution
```

## Complexity Levels

| Level  | Indicadores               | Deliverables                |
| ------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| L1-L2  | Bug fix, single function  | Atomic tasks                |
| L3-L5  | Feature, multi-file       | Tasks + research + parallel |
| L6-L8  | Architecture, integration | + pre-mortem + ADR          |
| L9-L10 | Migrations, multi-service | + dependency graph          |

### Complexity Indicators

| Aumenta (+1 a +2) | Diminuye (-1)       |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Multi files       | Patterns existentes |
| DB changes        | Similar code        |
| Auth              | Isolated            |
| 3rd party APIs    | Tests exist         |
| Breaking changes  |                     |
| Security          |                     |
| Multi-service     |                     |

## Task Granularity

**Each step is ONE action (2-5 minutes):**

- "Write the failing test" — step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" — step
- "Implement minimal code to pass" — step
- "Run tests and verify pass" — step
- "Commit" — step

```
❌ "Implement auth" (too big)
✅ "Add Zod schema for login form" (atomic)
```

### Task Requirements

- Exact file paths with line ranges
- Complete code (never "add validation" or "implement logic")
- Validation command with expected output
- Rollback implicit: undo the change
- Dependencies marked with ⚡ PARALLEL-SAFE

---

## Phase Organization

### Sequential Phases

```markdown
### Phase 1: Foundation [SEQUENTIAL]

> Must complete before next phase

- Task 1.1
- Task 1.2
```

### Parallel Phases

```markdown
### Phase 2: Core [PARALLEL]

> ⚡ PARALLEL-SAFE: Can run simultaneously

- Task 2.1 (debugger)
- Task 2.2 (frontend-specialist)
- Task 2.3 (debugger)
```

## Confidence Scoring

| Score | Significado               | Ação                |
| ----- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **5** | Verified in codebase/docs | Use directly        |
| **4** | Multiple sources agree    | Use with confidence |
| **3** | Community consensus       | Note uncertainty    |
| **2** | Single source/unverified  | Flag as assumption  |
| **1** | Speculation               | Don't rely on it    |

**Rule:** Findings ≤ 2 MUST be flagged and validated before relying.

## Agent Selection

| Complexity | Pattern    | Agents           | Parallel? |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| L1-L2      | Direct     | None             | N/A       |
| L3         | Subagent   | 1 explorer | No        |
| L4-L5      | Swarm      | 2-3 subagents    | YES       |
| L6-L8      | Team       | 3-5 teammates    | YES       |
| L9-L10     | Full Swarm | 5+               | YES       |

### Parallel Patterns

**Subagent (L3):**

```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: "explorer",
  prompt: "Research [topic]",
});
```

**Swarm (L4-L5):**

```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: "explorer",
  prompt: "Research X",
  run_in_background: true,
});
Task({
  subagent_type: "explorer",
  prompt: "Research Y",
  run_in_background: true,
});
```

**Agent Team (L6+):**

```typescript
TeamCreate({ team_name: "plan-{slug}" });
TaskCreate({ subject: "Research", owner: "debugger" });
TaskUpdate({ taskId: "1", owner: "debugger" });
```

---

## L6+ Additions

For complex tasks (L6+), add these sections:

### Risk Assessment

```markdown
## Risk Assessment

| Risk     | Probability  | Impact       | Mitigation        |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------------- |
| [Risk 1] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [How to mitigate] |
```

### Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

```markdown
## ADR: [Decision Title]

**Context:** [Why this decision was needed]

**Decision:** [What was decided]

**Alternatives Considered:**

1. [Alternative 1] — Rejected because [...]
2. [Alternative 2] — Rejected because [...]

**Consequences:** [Trade-offs accepted]
```

> See `references/03-risk.md` for full pre-mortem protocol.

## Pre-Commit Checklist

Before presenting plan:

- [ ] Research complete (codebase, docs, edge cases)
- [ ] Atomic tasks (2-5 min each step)
- [ ] Exact paths with line ranges
- [ ] Complete code provided
- [ ] Parallel tasks marked with ⚡

## Execution Handoff

After plan is approved and saved:

> **Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`**
>
> **Options:**
>
> 1. **Implement now** — `/implement` to execute
> 2. **Review first** — Open plan file and review
> 3. **Modify plan** — Adjust before execution

---

## Remember

- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits
- One action per step (2-5 minutes)
